# This project was dedicated to the Plagiarism detection system

This is a simple GUI app developed using the Tkinter technology of windows, to help the people to catch a plagiarism.
Detect similarity in several documents(.docx) using Cosine Similarity methods.

We can say that there are no such applications for checking documents in the Kazakh language, 
so we wanted to release an application for checking plagiarism for the Kazakh audience,
 especially for teachers and school students, and thanks to the fight against plagiarism, 
we will be able to raise the education system, students will search for themselves, 
and not just copy tasks from the Internet, thus we will contribute to the prosperity of our country
